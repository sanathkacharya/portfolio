# 📧 Email Deliverability Guide

This guide helps prevent your portfolio contact form emails from going to junk/spam folders.

## 🚨 Common Reasons Emails Go to Junk

### 1. **From Address Issues**
- ❌ Using `noreply@` addresses (spam trigger)
- ❌ Generic sender names like "Portfolio Contact"
- ❌ Mismatched domain names

### 2. **Subject Line Problems**
- ❌ Excessive emojis (📧🙏💬)
- ❌ ALL CAPS text
- ❌ Spam trigger words: "Free", "Act Now", "Limited Time"

### 3. **Content Issues**
- ❌ HTML-only emails (no text version)
- ❌ Too many images or links
- ❌ Poor HTML structure

### 4. **Technical Issues**
- ❌ Missing email headers
- ❌ No proper authentication
- ❌ High sending volume from new domain

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Improved From Address**
```javascript
// Before
from: 'Portfolio Contact <noreply@aswincloud.com>'

// After  
from: 'Aswin Portfolio <contact@aswincloud.com>'
```

### 2. **Clean Subject Lines**
```javascript
// Before
subject: '📧 New Portfolio Contact from ${name}'
subject: '🙏 Thank you for contacting me!'

// After
subject: 'New Portfolio Contact from ${name}'
subject: 'Thank you for contacting me - Aswin Portfolio'
```

### 3. **Added Email Headers**
```javascript
headers: {
  'X-Priority': '1',
  'X-MSMail-Priority': 'High', 
  'Importance': 'high',
  'X-Mailer': 'Aswin Portfolio Contact Form'
}
```

### 4. **Added Reply-To Headers**
```javascript
// Admin email - reply goes to visitor
replyTo: email

// User email - reply goes to you
replyTo: process.env.CONTACT_EMAIL
```

### 5. **Added Text Versions**
- Both HTML and text versions included
- Improves deliverability significantly
- Better accessibility

## 🔧 Additional Steps to Take

### 1. **Domain Authentication**
Set up these DNS records for `aswincloud.com`:

#### SPF Record
```
TXT @ "v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all"
```

#### DKIM Record
Resend will provide this when you verify your domain.

#### DMARC Record
```
TXT _dmarc "v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@aswincloud.com"
```

### 2. **Verify Your Domain in Resend**
1. Go to [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Add `aswincloud.com` as a domain
3. Follow the DNS setup instructions
4. Wait for verification (can take 24-48 hours)

### 3. **Warm Up Your Domain**
- Start with low volume (1-2 emails per day)
- Gradually increase over 2-4 weeks
- Monitor deliverability metrics

### 4. **Monitor and Test**
- Check spam folder regularly
- Use tools like [Mail Tester](https://www.mail-tester.com/)
